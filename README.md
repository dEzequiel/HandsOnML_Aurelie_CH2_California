# California Housing – Data Preprocessing

This repository contains a small project based on the California Housing dataset from Hands-On Machine Learning.
It demonstrates the essential steps of a preprocessing workflow:

- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Cleaning data and handling missing values
- Feature engineering (including a custom transformer)
- Encoding and scaling using pipelines
